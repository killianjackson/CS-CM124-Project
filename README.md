# CS-CM124-Project
Final Project 3: Relatedness Estimator

- Given the genotypes of several individuals, how are all of them related?
- Parents transmit 1 chromosome to each child. Siblings share approximately 50% of their DNA. 1st cousins share about 25% of their DNA.
- A challenge is that some individuals may share DNA by chance.
- Consider a SNP with minor allele frequency of 0.1
- What is the probability of having the allele on both chromosomes?
- If your brother has the allele on both chromosomes, what is your probabilty of having the allele on both your chromosomes? (Hint: It is much higher)
- What about minor allele frequency of 0.01 or 0.4?
- What allele frequencies are most informative? (Tradeoff between occurrence of alleles and information in sibling)

Objective: Construct a method for determining whether 2 individuals are siblings.
